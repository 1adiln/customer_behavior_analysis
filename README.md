## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

**Steps Performed:**

* Imported the dataset using pandas
* Performed initial exploration using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`
* Handled missing values in the Review Rating column by imputing median ratings per product category
* Standardized column names to snake_case for clarity and consistency
* Feature Engineering:

  * Created `age_group` by binning customer ages
  * Created `purchase_frequency_days` using purchase history
* Checked for redundancy between discount_applied and promo_code_used; removed promo_code_used
* Loaded the cleaned DataFrame into a PostgreSQL database for SQL analysis
